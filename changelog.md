##MooTools More change log

#### Changes in MooTools More 1.5.0.1

* More than 100 commits!
* Far too many bug fixes to count

* Form Validator now uses event delegation to watch inputs and whatnot.
* New Array.Extras method: `Array.pluck`
* Numerous updates to language files
* Swiff moved to More from Core

#### Changes in MooTools More 1.3.0.1

* 40 tickets closed (see the milestones for [1.3.0.1rc1](https://mootools.lighthouseapp.com/projects/24057/milestones/83468) and [1.3.0.1](https://mootools.lighthouseapp.com/projects/24057/milestones/87438) in Lighthouse)
* Misc
  * All the code of MooTools More now uses MooTools Core 1.3 internally.
  * There is built-in compatibility for all API improvements, except for Element.get not setting anymore. See [the Core wiki](http://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/wiki/Update-from-1.2-to-1.3) for compatibility for this.
  * Log.js is no more; [you can download it from source via github](http://github.com/mootools/mootools-more/blob/1.2.4.4/Source/Core/Log.js)
* Fx.Reveal
  * Revised Fx.Reveal. Element getters don't accept options anymore, so `Element.get('reveal', options)` is not possible anymore (just like Fx.Tween and Fx.Morph in Core).
* Hash
  * Moved Hash.js from MooTools Core to MooTools More which is not part of MooTools Core 1.3 (without compatibily layer) anymore.
  * Changed Hash.Extras to Object.Extras. However, Hash.Extras still exists for compatibility.
* Events
  * Added Events.Pseudos and Element.Event.Pseudos to abstract Element.Delegation :relay.
  * Added `:once` pseudo for Events and Element.Event and `:keys` to Element.Event, both through the new Event(s).definePseudo.

  * now supports the `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events.
* Request.JSONP
  * Rewritten - much more readable and manageable; the retries option has been removed.

  * New YAML package and dependency declarations
  * Depender.js is no more; [use the server app](http://github.com/anutron/mootools-depender).

* Class.Refactor
  * Class.Refactor now allows calls to `this.previous` for methods that may not exist in the previous state.

* Form.Request
  * now passes along the request arguments to `Form.Request`'s events.

  * reenabled the previous keyboard when the current one is dropped.

#### Changes in MooTools More 1.2.4.3

* Nearly 50 bug fixes ([see the milestone for 1.2.4.3 in Lighthouse](https://mootools.lighthouseapp.com/projects/24057/milestones/54424-1243)).
* Keyboard:
  * Added some support for just pressing 'shift', 'control', or 'alt'
  * Added a bunch of keycodes for Mac compatibility
* Keyboard.Extras:
  * Support for "shortcuts" which are keyboard entries that have names and descriptions.
  * Also provides methods for listing all the active shortcuts as well as allowing a shortcut to be rebound (for instance, if you were to allow the user to choose a key for a shortcut).
  * Added a change event to Keyboard.manager whenever any keyboard is activated.
* Tips:
  * They work again (I know, that's not really a feature).
  * NEW Tips option "windowPadding" allows you to reduce or expand the virtual size of the window for tip positioning. Defaults to `{x:0, y:0}`. You can use that is a workaround for the scrollbars not being considered when calculating tip positions.
* HtmlTable:
  * fixed numerous bugs filed in Lighthouse
  * ensuring that HtmlTable doesn't apply it's click behavior more than once...
  * fixing a bug where HtmlTable couldn't push headers defined in the options.
  * reworking HtmlTable's dom a bit to allow for positioning of the sort icon
  * adding new set method for headers and footers.
  * Fixed error in HtmlTable.Parsers when sorting by date. format('db') was being applied to the text and not the date object.
* Array:
  * Added Array.shuffle
* Request.JSONP:
  * making JSONP pass all arguments, not just the first, to its complete/success methods; [see this discussion on the google group](http://groups.google.com/group/mootools-users/browse_thread/thread/9cfa52bf0cf05bac).
* Fx.Slide:
  * Added an option to specify the wrapper element for Fx.Slide. Was already present in the docs but could not be passed as an option.
* Mask:
  * adding options for the IframeShim for Mask

#### Changes in MooTools More 1.2.4.2

* Per the change in -core, $ is no longer used (uses document.id instead)
* Element.Measure: trying cssText solution for Element.expose (again).
* Element.Forms: swapping feature detection for browser support per
* Date: Massive refactoring of Date.js and Date.Extras.js
* Drag.Move: Fixing drag with grid issues
* IframeShim: altering zindex assignment in IframeShim to better ensure that it’s always underneath the shimmed element, updating Iframeshim’s empty document creation; fixes https issues in IE6
* FormValidator: reworking formvalidator scroll-to logic to be a little more efficient
* OverText: preventing overtext from focusing on inputs except when they are interacted with (so OverText.update() does not focus an input);now stops polling when elements are hidden (when polling is enabled)
* Fx.Scroll: adding scrollIntoView method - scrolls an element so that it is completely visible; if below the view, scrolls down until it is at the bottom of the screen, if above, scrolls up until it is at the top.
* JSONP: was calling (the deprecated) this.request instead of this.send during retries
* URI: Adding set(‘data’, obj) to set

* Numerous small fixes, speed improvements, documentation tweaks, etc.

#### Changes in MooTools More 1.2.4.1

* [roughly a dozen issues fixed or closed (in lighthouse)](https://mootools.lighthouseapp.com/projects/24057-mootoolsmore/tickets?q=milestone%3A1.2.4.1)
* Numerous documentation updates

* Form.Validator, Date: Added Ukrainian translations
* Date: Added new Date parser (parses "Thu Oct 22 08:11:23 +0000 2009")

* Tips: Restoring arguments to the show/hide events; tip no longer defaults to display:none (this restores the previous behavior)
* Fx.Reveal: stores cssText whenever it starts a transition and restores it when it finishes or is canceled, leaving the element without a bunch of inline styles, as if you'd just done setStyle('display', 'block'/'none')
* Fx.SmoothScroll: adding a "scrolledTo" event
* Drag: added new 'stopPropagation' option
* HtmlTable.Select: ensuring that instances only delegates to immediate children (for nested tables)
* HtmlTable.Sort.js: detects and sorts date columns more accurately, handles negative integers and floats
* Reorganized scripts json so Depender can implement Log

#### Breaking Changes from Clientcide

* IframeShim
